  "body": "### A lightweight PHP process manager\r\nA simple, lightweight PHP package that handles your worker processes without needing to run them manually. Nyx handles your worker processes for you by making sure they stay alive, even when you are asleep.\r\n\r\n### Easy to install\r\nSimply download the `phar` from https://github.com/steadweb/nyx/raw/master/nyx.phar. You'll need a `nyx.json` configuration file in order to run `php nyx.phar run`.\r\n\r\n### Simple configuration\r\n`Nyx` uses JSON for configuration. It's easy, and allows you to manage the number of workers required for each pool. Example config below showing the bare minimum required.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"workers\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"count\": \"1\",\r\n      \"path\": \"ping 8.8.8.8\",\r\n      \"options\": {\r\n        \"in\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"pipe\",\r\n          \"command\": \"r\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"out\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"file\",\r\n          \"command\": \"/tmp/google-ping.log\",\r\n          \"options\": \"a\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"err\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"file\",\r\n          \"command\": \"/tmp/google-ping-error.log\",\r\n          \"options\": \"a\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"count\": \"1\",\r\n      \"path\": \"ping 8.8.4.4\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"path\": \"echo 'Random number:' $RANDOM\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nSubmit a ticket via https://github.com/steadweb/nyx if you find a bug or would like to see a feature implemented. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nLuke Steadman (@steadweb)\r\n",
